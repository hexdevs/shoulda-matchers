rails 8_1

- needed to add `gem 'readline'` to the gemfile

rails 8_0

- no changes needed

rails 7_2

- needed to add readline and ostruct to gemfile
- having the same minitest error as rails 8_1?

rails 7_1

- needed to add readline and ostruct to gemfile as well
- might need to constrain the minitest version to [5.16.1](https://github.com/minitest/minitest/blob/master/History.rdoc#label-5.26.1+-2F+2025-11-08), which has Ruby 4 support.
  # gem 'minitest', '~> 5.26.1'

todo:

- run specs for all gemfiles (minitest version constraint needed?)
- push and see how it goes in CI
- update rubocop ruby target


removed --install binstubs to get rid of this warning message. Since it's
a new test rails app, i just removed it instead of doing the steps mentioned in
the message:

 Beginning in Rails 4, Rails ships with a `rails` binstub at ./bin/rails that
       should be used instead of the Bundler-generated `rails` binstub.

       If you are seeing this message, your binstub at ./bin/rails was generated by
       Bundler instead of Rails.

       You might need to regenerate your `rails` binstub locally and add it to source
       control:

        rails app:update:bin           # Bear in mind this generates other binstubs
                                       # too that you may or may not want (like yarn)

       If you already have Rails binstubs in source control, you might be
       inadvertently overwriting them during deployment by using bundle install
       with the --binstubs option.

       If your application was created prior to Rails 4, here's how to upgrade:

         bundle config --delete bin    # Turn off Bundler's stub generator
         rails app:update:bin          # Use the new Rails executables
         git add bin                   # Add bin/ to source control

       You may need to remove bin/ from your .gitignore as well.

       When you install a gem whose executable you want to use in your app,
       generate it and add it to source control:

         bundle binstubs some-gem-name
         git add bin/new-executable
